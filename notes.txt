-supervised learning
-label: action (how quick to move (rest,...,full speed), what direction)
-feature: current state (environment, own specs (energy, vision, velocity, current heading))
-feature label pair selection: select feature label pairs from runs that lasted long in comparison
to the other runs in this batch (in timesteps)

-generate training data:
spawn x turtles and let them run 1000 times, for each run record what each turtle does and 
take the recording of the longest turtle as training data, so in the end we have a batch of 
1000 samples

-training:
train the ML decision making model

-go back to generating training data:
this time the training data should be improved as the turtles now use the trained ML decision making model

-repeat until turtles dont improve anymore

-how to measure quality of run? how long the turtle survives

-fix turtle stats (energy etc) as the training data would only contain runs from turtles with good stats 
and therefore the model would know what to do with weak turtles

-later the performance measure could be adjusted to be relative to the stats of the turtles, so that
turtles with bad stats that perform well also get added into the training pool, e.g. (everything between 0 and 1)
performance = runtime * (1 + 1-energy) * (1 + 1-vision) * (1 + 1-velocity) * (1 + energy consumption)
